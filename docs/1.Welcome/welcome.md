# Overview
Yor is an open-source tool that helps to manage tags in a consistent manner across infrastructure as code frameworks 
(Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, and Serverless Framework). By auto-tagging in IaC you will be able to trace any cloud resource from code to cloud.

# IaC Types
Yor enables version-controlled owner assignment and resource tracing based git history. It also can extend tag enforcement logic by loading external tagging logic into the CI/CD pipeline. 

Yor can tag these IaC file types:
  * Terraform (for AWS, GCP and Azure)
  * CloudFormation (YAML, JSON)
  * Serverless
  * K8S (YAML, JSON)

# Tracing Tagger
```yor_trace``` tag enables full attribution between build time and run time resources. Using unique Yor GUID, you'll be able to track your runtime resource that is rely on a resource block in your IaC files. Tracing between the two enables better visibility of your assets and detecting drifts between build time and runtime resources across IaC frameworks and multiple cloud providers. See examples [here](<add publi link to 5.usecases once published>)

# Git-based Tagger
```git_*``` tags connect cloud resources to individual git commits and enable assigning clear ownership between developers and the resources they routinely change.

Yor collects data from [git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) and enables mapping individual resources to specific commits.

### Supported tags

```
git_org = "bridgecrewio"
git_repo = "terragoat"
git_file = "README.md" # this is the path from the repo root dir...
git_commit = "47accf06f13b503f3bab06fed7860e72f7523cac" # This is the latest commit for this resource
git_last_modified_At = "2020-03-28 21:42:46 +0000 UTC"
git_last_modified_by = "schosterbarak@gmail.com"
git_modifiers = "schosterbarak/baraks" # These are extracted from the emails, everything before the @ sign. Can be done for modified_by tag as well
```
