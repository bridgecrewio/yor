Cloud service providers allow users to assign metadata to their cloud resources in the form
of tags. Each tag is a simple label consisting of a customer-defined key and a value
that can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources. Although there are no
inherent types of tags, they enable customers to categorize resources by purpose, owner,
environment, or other criteria.

Tags can be used for security, cost allocation, automation, console organization, access control, and operations. 

Yor is an open-source tool that helps to manage tags in a consistent manner across infrastructure as code frameworks (Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, and Serverless Framework) .
By auto-tagging in IaC you will be able to trace any cloud resource from code to cloud. 
Yor enables version-controlled owner assignment and resource tracing based git history. It also can extend tag enforcement logic by loading external tagging logic into the CI/CD pipeline. 


## Features

* Yor collects data from [git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) and enables mapping individual resources to specific commits. It can be run automatically  
* ```yor_trace``` tag enables full attribution between build time and run time resources. 
* ```git_*``` tags  connect cloud resources to individual git commits and enable assigning clear ownership between developers and the resources they routinely change.

 

### Supported tags

```
yor_trace = "842fa55e-c0f8-4f79-a56d-a046a24d8e08"
git_org = "bridgecrewio"
git_repo = "terragoat"
git_file = "README.md" # this is the path from the repo root dir...
git_commit = "47accf06f13b503f3bab06fed7860e72f7523cac" # This is the latest commit for this resource
git_last_modified_At = "2020-03-28 21:42:46 +0000 UTC"
git_last_modified_by = "schosterbarak@gmail.com"
git_modifiers = "schosterbarak/baraks" # These are extracted from the emails, everything before the @ sign. Can be done for modified_by tag as well
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

On MacOS

```sh
brew install yor
```



### Usage

* Tag an entire directory

```sh
./yor tag --directory terraform/
```

### Skipping tags 

Using command line flags you can specify to run only named tags (allow list) or run all tags except 
those listed (deny list).

```sh
./yor tag -d . --skip-tags yor_trace
## Run all but yor_trace

./yor tag -d . --skip-tags yor_trace,git_modifiers
## Run all but yor_trace and git_modifiers

./yor tag -d . --skip-tags git*
## Run all tags except tags with specified patterns
```

### Skipping directories

Using the command line flag skip-paths you can define paths which won't be tagged.
Be mindful that the skipped path should include the root dir path. See example below:

```sh
./yor tag -d path/to/files
## Run on the directory path/to/files

./yor tag -d path/to/files --skip-dirs path/to/files/skip,path/to/files/another/skip2
## Run yor on the directory path/to/files, skipping path/to/files/skip/ and path/to/files/another/skip2/
```

### Output formats

```sh
./yor tag -d . -o cli
# default cli output

./yor tag -d . -o json
# json output

./yor tag -d . --output cli --output-json-file result.json
# will print cli output and additional output to file on json file -- enables prgormatic analysis alongside printing human readable result
```

### Loading External Tags Using Plugins

#### Prerequisites

An example can be found in `tests/yor_plugins/example`

1. Create tags implementing the `ITag` interface.
2. If you wish to override an existing tag, make the tag's method `GetPriority()` return a positive number. Otherwise, return `0` or a negative number.
3. Create a file located in package `main` that exposes a variable `ExtraTags` - array containing pointers to all tags implemented.
4. Run command `go build -gcflags="all=-N -l" -buildmode=plugin -o <plugin-dir>/extra_tags.so <plugin-dir>/*.go`

```go
package main

var ExtraTags = []interface{}{&TerragoatTag{}, &CheckovTag{}}
```

#### Running yor

```sh
./yor tag --custom-tagger tests/yor_plugins/example
# run yor with custom tags located in tests/yor_plugins/example
```

Using docker:
```sh
docker pull bridgecrew/yor

docker run --tty --volume /local/path/to/tf:/tf bridgecrew/yor tag --directory /tf
```


#### Troubleshooting
If you encounter the following error: 
`plugin was built with a different version of package ...`

Build yor with `go build -gcflags="all=-N -l"`


## Contributing

Contribution is welcomed! 

We are working on extending Yor and adding more parsers (to support additional IaC frameworks) and more taggers (to tag using other contextual data).

To maintain our conventions, please run lint on your branch before opening a PR. To run lint:
```sh
golangci-lint run --fix --skip-dirs tests/yor_plugins
```
