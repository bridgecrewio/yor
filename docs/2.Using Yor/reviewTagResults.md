# Reviewing Tag Results
You can assume that each resource that is being tagged using Yor has a diff view. For example -

![Diff View](../yor_diff_view.png)

After applying `./yor tag` command, you will get the CLI Findings Summary. This is also available once you are running
`./yor tag -d . -o cli`

![Yor Summary](../yor_summary.png)

Use the following commands to display the tags that are currently used.
```sh
./yor tag -d . -o json
# json output

./yor tag -d . --output cli --output-json-file result.json
# will print cli output and additional output to file on json file -- enables programatic analysis alongside printing human readable result
```

For a JSON file example see

![YOR JSON Results](../yor_json_results.png)
